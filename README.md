## Problem Statement

In the modern age, we are inundated with a vast amount of data in various formats, including scanned documents, PDFs, and images. Converting these sources into digital formats that are easy to process and analyze is crucial, but manually transcribing text from images can be time-consuming and error-prone. 
The frequent production of errors in output when converting images to text is a prevalent issue with existing image-to-text scanners. In order to address this issue, the team has decided to develop an image-to-text scanner that can effectively reduce errors and produce accurate text outputs with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.
The aim of this project is to develop a Flask web application that can accurately extract text from image files by integrating Tesseract OCR.


## Proposed Approach

The envisioned solution involves building a web application using Flask that allows users to upload image files, which will then be subjected to text extraction using Tesseract OCR. The extracted text will be presented in a readable format, with the option to copy. Testing has been conducted on the application using a range of image file formats to ensure the accuracy of the text extraction process.
